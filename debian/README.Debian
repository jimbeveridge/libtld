libtld for Debian
-----------------

Note that this package is really only temporarily up to date. The file:

   src/tld_data.xml

Needs to be updated each time new gTLDs are accepted by INA and other
organizations.

In most cases, we try to keep the library up to date. However, changes to
gTLD entries are not all published in one clear place.
