* REFERENCE

The PHP extension reference can be found online here:

http://snapwebsites.org/project/libtld

Also check out the References and click on the latest version of the libtld
reference on that page.

* REQUIREMENTS

In order to get the PHP plugin to work you need the php5-dev environment.

* COMPILING

Then run the php/build script. Note that this script currently expects
that you built the libtld library one directory up (change the version
as required):

   cd .../libtld-1.4.0
   mkdir ../BUILD
   (cd ../BUILD; cmake ../libtld-1.4.0)
   make -C ../BUILD
   cd php
   ./build

* INSTALLATION

The build script copies the php_libtld.so file to the right php5 directory
automatically (although you are more than welcome to verify the script
first!) Note that the script makes use of the sudo command.

Once the script succeeded, you then need to edit your .ini files and include
the following extension parameter (usually at the bottom of the file):

   extension=php_libtld.so

You will have to restart Apache2 if you want that to run there. Something
like this under Linux:

   service apache2 restart

(reload won't do it under a Debian system. RedHat reload and restart are the
same though.)

Then you can start using the libtld library from PHP with the scripts as:

   $a = check_tld('www.m2osw.com');
   var_dump($a);

The results of the check_tlr() and check_uri() are either FALSE or an array
with the different fields as found in the tld_info structure:

   array(5) {
     ["result"]=>
     int(0)
     ["category"]=>
     int(0)
     ["status"]=>
     int(0)
     ["offset"]=>
     int(9)
     ["tld"]=>
     string(4) ".com"
   }

If it worked, then $a['result'] == 0 and $a['status'] == 0. Before checking
$a as an array, do this:

  if ($a === FALSE) ... handle error ...

You may consider including the php_libtld.php file to get result, category,
and status definitions.

The library now supports 3 functions in PHP:

   check_tld();
   check_uri();
   check_email();

These are now documented in the library reference under the php/php_libtld.c
file (once in the reference you will see a Files tab near the top, click on
it and navigate to php/php_libtld.c).
